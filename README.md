Because of the privacy demanded by the collaborating institution, the datasets used cannot be shared. In consequence, this repository keeps just the scripts that have been used to develop the corresponding methodology and a .zip file that contains the scripts under the needed structure created to extract and save the results in each step.

In the following graph you can see a detailed flow of the outputs and inputs for each one.
